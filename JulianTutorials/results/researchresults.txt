Leaflet Routing Machine resutls:
        Following the tutorial on the LRM website (https://www.liedman.net/leaflet-routing-machine/tutorials/basic-usage/) was unsucessful and had numerous errors that I was unable to find a solution for.
        Demos on https://codesandbox.io/examples/package/leaflet-routing-machine had the same result. They worked on the website they were on, but I was unable to get any of them to run on my codespace on github. Hours of copying over and testing them resulted in nothing.
        Other online tutorials had similar results. My lacking knowledge of js may be part of the issue however.
        
        I'm concluding that this means that LRM is unlikely to be a good choice for our project. I'm planning to consult the group about how to proceed.
