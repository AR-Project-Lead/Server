Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the user's current node and the node they're trying to get to 
without using node or edges that have tags the user wants to avoid.

Possible algorithms to use:
    - Dijkstra's
    - Prim's


We intend to have only positively weighted edges (representing horizontal distance), Dijkstra's algorithm seems best fit for 
finding the shortest possible accessible route.
