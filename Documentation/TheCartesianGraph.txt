To make the cartesian planes to use for the pathfinding:

    - download the PDF of a floorplan for an RPI building via QUACS git repository: https://github.com/quacs/quacs-data/tree/master/floor_plans
    - use GIMP to turn the PDF into a PNG file
    - upload that floorplan PNG to Desmos and stretch the image by clicking and dragging one corner of it so that the 
        top and bottom of the image are horizontal lines on y=50 and y=-50


Next question:
    - from this we can either record the cartesian coordinates of the corners of every node so that we know the space for
        pathfinding OR we can get a line for the middle of every node and consider that the path. Whatever data we get from these
        graphs is dependent on how we want to make the pathfinding software work which is dependent on how we want to convey the
        path to the user which is dependent on what's the simplest, quickest thing we can make that will be helpful for disabled
        students.
