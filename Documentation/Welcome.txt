Welcome to Accessible Routes!

Goal of the project: route someone from wherever they are on campus to whever they want to go without the physical
barriers that would keep them from reaching their destination, or if no such routes exist say that.

For now, we're specifically interested in helping physically disabled students get to their classes and around main campus.
There are other people who we anticipate using our application, however, if it comes to making a decision that will either
aid physically disabled students or another user, we will prioritize aiding the physically disabled students.

Target users:
    - students who use mobility aids such as wheelchairs, canes, and crutches
    - 

Other anticipated users:
    - able-bodied people carrying stuff on carts
    - physically disabled non-students
    - able-bodied people trying to get to someplace they've never been before
