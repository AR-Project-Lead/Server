Changing the database

- get rid of room_door relation
- put coordinate into room relation
- adding door_coordinate to the key because there are multiple doors to a room
- the coordinate for room is the coordinate of the door (in the hallway technically, 
  but as previous discussed it's right outside the door so if you can get to right outside the door, that gets you to the door)
- reorganizing spreadsheets to accommodate this

rooms can be represented by multiple tuples, based on coordinate - coordinate was added to primary key
- coordinate is door for room (some rooms have multiple doors)
- for hallways the coord will be at its starts, finishes, and turns


decided 'Gym' is not a legal room_type but instead gyms will just be null... since byms have names anyway (specificlaly 87 gym)
