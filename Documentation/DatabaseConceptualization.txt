In order to store data about campus and it's accessibility such that we can find paths between 
any two spots on campus, we represented every building on campus as a graph (as in graph theory)
of nodes and edges, as well as a graph on a cartesian plane.

The graph theory graph:
    - Nodes:
        Nodes in the graph represent rooms, hallways, auditoriums, elevators, stairwells, and other spaces that have walls
    - Edges:
        Edges connect nodes, so they represent doors and doorways

The cartesian-plane graph:
    We will superimpose a cartesian plane over the floorplans which we are getting our data from. This way nodes will have
    cartesian coordinates and one node per building will have actual lattitude/longitude coordinates, so we will know wherever
    every node is relative to eachother and can use math to find where they are in space in reference to the node which has 
    the geo-coordinates. In order for this to work, we need a scale of sorts on the floorplans so that we can convert between
    distance on the cartesian plane and real-life horizontal distance. In order for this to work, we must also ensure we have 
    floorplans of every building we want to include for possible routing.
