Looking over the database and trying to input data:

Issues:
- seem to be getting an issue with using arrays as a data type
	- when trying to input data for room_name specifically (which is a varchar array), I keep getting an error: "missing data for column "room_name"" despite me giving a value for that attribute
	- doing the method with copy from stdin doesn't work for me, so I instead tried to do a single insert statement, which did work
	- however, this would end up being very tedious, so we want to try to take the data directly from the csv file (see below)
- undecided on whether we need to use a custom type or just use a varchar (specifically for room_type attribute)
- is there any easy way to just input the data from the csv files into the database without manually line by line adding them in


To insert data into database directly from the csv file:

- rearrange the spreadsheets so that the columns are in the same order as the database relation schemas (or rearrange order of schemas)
- also need to add attributes that are in the schema but not the spreadsheet (like building_name)
- also extend floor number to all rooms on that floor
- get rid of exra empty cells (rows)
- need to go through sheets and update room types according to the custom type (enum) as defined in the database ('Hall' vs 'Hallway') (also capitalization)
	- make sure all types in the spreadsheet are seen in th enum (ex: 'Bathroom (W)' vs 'Bathroom (M)')


Notes on how to fix csv files to match inputting into the database:

- for arrays format "{a,b,c}"
- for null put '' (empty)
	- or actually 
- null array format: 
	- null array is just null
	- array with null values is "{,}"
- NOTE: DO NOT FORGET THAT KEYS CANNOT BE NULL


Example for importing from csv: (for more info see https://blog.skyvia.com/3-easy-ways-to-import-csv-file-to-sql-server/ )

Use the following:
\copy room from 'RPI Campus as Nodes and Edges - 87 Gym.csv' delimiter ',' csv header null as '' ;
\copy room from 'RPI Campus as Nodes and Edges - DCC.csv' delimiter ',' csv header null as '' ;
\copy room from 'RPI Campus as Nodes and Edges - Amos Eaton.csv' delimiter ',' csv header null as '' ;

Running on my own machine (tested with a testing.csv file):
\copy room from 'C:/Users/Isabele Lieber/OneDrive - Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute/classes/RCOS/Accessible-Routes/87 Gym.csv' delimiter ',' csv header null as '' ;
